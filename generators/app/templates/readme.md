after getting the files in the directory 

run 

npm install

gulp

and then in another terminal npm start

this should rebuild when the files change and it should serve the static content first and then if there are no static content it will server the server generated content


visit /built two times on a clean install and see it change the second time

do a gulp clear and then gulp to see it again
